#Here we make our first code in python
print("hello world")
#For the assigment you should write a different sentence
#You should be careful of quotation marks
#For a string is recommendable to use double-quotes since they are likely to contain single-quote characters as part of the string itself
print("Hello, my name is Elizabeth. I'm from Ecuador")
